# ProjectFocus: AI-Driven Strategic Kanban 🚀

**ProjectFocus** is a project management ecosystem designed to eliminate operational noise in complex R&D environments. Unlike traditional Kanban boards, this platform prioritizes individual execution through an intelligent "To-Do" view driven by strategic goals.

> **Status:** Active Development (Core Backend & API Infrastructure).

## 🎯 The Vision
In large-scale projects, the bottleneck isn't the lack of tasks, but the loss of focus. **SmartKanban: Orchestrator** is built to bridge the gap between high-level roadmaps and daily execution:
1.  **Smart Prioritization:** Automatically filters the global Kanban board into a personalized "Focus-List" for each user based on target dates and project weight.
2.  **AI-Powered Optimization (Future):** An integrated engine to analyze Epic progress and suggest real-time workload adjustments.
3.  **Executive Visibility:** High-level dashboards featuring project health metrics and Roadmap views for Management.

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture
The project follows a decoupled architecture to ensure scalability and independent deployment:

* **[Backend Service (FastAPI)]([LINK_TO_YOUR_BACKEND_REPO](https://github.com/Ferranarna/Kanban-list)):** Business logic engine, user authentication, and MySQL persistence.
* **[Frontend App (React)](In progress):** Dynamic User Interface with a focus on high-productivity UX.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI (Backend), React (Frontend).
- **Database:** MySQL (Relational architecture).
- **AI Strategy:** Future integration of LLMs for predictive timeline analysis and bottleneck detection.

## 📈 Roadmap
